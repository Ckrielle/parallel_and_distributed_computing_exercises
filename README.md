# Parallel & Distributed Computing Exercises in C

Literally what the name says, uni had a course on threading, and I solved it's weekly exercises in C. Normally the course is taught in Java, but that's because most students can't or would rather not handle C. So the prof teaches it in Java, but still let's students solve them in any other language. I like low level stuff and I saw this as an opportunity to get some C training, so that's why I chose it. Though it made it harder and more time consuming. But still worth it (copium). Really wished I could have done them in python, mostly because it would have helped me with other stuff I do (e.g. CTFs), but oh welp.

It's kinda cringe to upload typical uni exercises (and not for example a good standalone uni project), but I choose to be a little cringe, never hurt anybody. And I hope that it can help other people in one way or another.

Number 7 is missing, that's cause I never did it.
